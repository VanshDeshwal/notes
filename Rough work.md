Recent state-of-the-art Deep-Learning architectures for encrypted traffic classifications demonstrated superb results in tasks of traffic categorization over encrypted traffic. In this paper, we leverage the feasibility to use such architectures for the tasks of malware detection and classification
we present a Deep-Learning model for malware traffic detection and classification (MalDIST), which outperforms both classical ML and DL malware traffic classification models both in terms of detection and classification.
Network trafic is encrypted to improve privacy, but that makes it harder to classify malicious traffic.
attackers are taking advantage of encryption to deliver malware inside the network.
Authors are transfering models from internet classification domain to malware traffic classification because the former has shown great results.
