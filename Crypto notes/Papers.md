# NetML: A Challenge for Network Traffic Analytics

## ABSTRACT  
Classifying network traffic is the base for key network services. Past work in this field had problems finding good data, and many results cannot be easily repeated. This issue grows worse with new data-driven machine learning methods. To fix this, we give three open datasets with almost 1.3 million labeled flows, including flow details and hidden raw packets, for all researchers. We look at wide parts of network traffic study, such as finding malware and telling applications apart. We offer the datasets as an open challenge called NetML1 and build simple machine learning models like random forest, SVM, and MLP. As NetML1 grows, we hope the data becomes a shared base for AI-based, repeatable work on network flow study. These resources include full details to help both academic and industry work on real flow analysis.

## 1. INTRODUCTION  
New technology now gives researchers a lot of data to study. Many papers in Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and, more recently, Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) use Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods [9, 22, 24, 26]. In CV and NLP, many shared test sets and open challenges exist, such as ImageNet [6] and NLP benchmarks [1]. However, NTA does not have a common set of data or challenges. This lack makes it hard for researchers to compare methods and repeat results accurately.

In our digital era, sorting network traffic is very important because the number of internet devices keeps growing fast. Network Traffic Analysis means grouping data flows into the right category. It is vital for tasks like quality of service (QoS) control, fair resource sharing, and finding malware. From a security view, more connected devices mean more possible cyber attacks. We must defend against these rising threats 1[https://github.com/ACANETS/NetML-Competition2020](https://github.com/ACANETS/NetML-Competition2020). Yet, finding full data sets to let researchers test their methods is hard. Getting the right data is another major problem.

Over time, NTA methods have changed from simple port-based checks to using machine learning. The port-based method relied on fixed port numbers, but modern apps use many different or random ports. Then, researchers used deep packet inspection (DPI) to look inside packet contents. As more data is encrypted, DPI has started to fail. This change pushed researchers to use machine learning on flow-level statistics, which do not need packet data or port numbers.

Many studies have tried to sort and study network flows using various data sets. But, unlike open sets such as ImageNet [6] and COCO [14] in computer vision, it remains hard to find up-to-date data sets in networking. Without shared data, researchers cannot easily test new ideas and others cannot repeat past experiments. A broad, open, and current data set for flow analytics is needed for the community to move forward together and to have clear benchmarks.

In this paper, we introduce the NetML Network Traffic Analytics data sets as a common platform for NTA research. We provide three free to use labeled flow collections with detailed features to serve as benchmarks. We focus on two main uses: malware detection and application type classification. For malware detection, we offer a new data set of almost 500,000 flows from raw traffic captures on the Stratosphere IPS site [20], covering twenty different malware and benign classes. We also build a data set from the well-known CICIDS2017 [19] raw traffic, with around 550,000 flows for seven malware types and a benign class.

We publish these sets as the NetML open challenge, with anonymized packets and flow feature details available to all researchers. We also share baseline AI models, including random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron methods. As NetML grows, we hope it becomes the shared basis for AI-driven, repeatable NTA research. With clear data and benchmarks, the network community can better compare methods, build on past work, and improve flow analytics for both academia and industry.
