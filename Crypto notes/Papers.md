# NetML: A Challenge for Network Traffic Analytics

## ABSTRACT  
Classifying network traffic is the base for key network services. Past work in this field had problems finding good data, and many results cannot be easily repeated. This issue grows worse with new data-driven machine learning methods. To fix this, we give three open datasets with almost 1.3 million labeled flows, including flow details and hidden raw packets, for all researchers. We look at wide parts of network traffic study, such as finding malware and telling applications apart. We offer the datasets as an open challenge called NetML1 and build simple machine learning models like random forest, SVM, and MLP. As NetML1 grows, we hope the data becomes a shared base for AI-based, repeatable work on network flow study. These resources include full details to help both academic and industry work on real flow analysis.
